				<h3>Our Mission</h3>
				<p>
					Unicorn Zombie Productions - &quot;Film and music production partnership.

Collaboration of artists and talent for content creation worldwide&quot;

(David Doblan &amp; Piter Beyt).

Our Goal at Unicorn Zombie Productions is to ultimately collaborate with

any visionary artist and content creators around the world to bring their ideas to life on

				</p>
				<h3>Our Product</h3>
				<p>
					Unicorn Zombie is known to release only the highest quality of production in video and

sound, which is something we take extreme pride in. We are able to work with any

creative individual and with no hesitation, absolutely guarantee to bring what they had

envisioned, to life. To demonstrate our remarkable work, we display sample

collaborative content on our website and social media channels to ensure our clients

have complete confidence in us. We begin by reviewing the footage our clients

assigned to us. Sitting down with them, whether in person or via online video chat, we

go over the process of how we put their idea together. Once we come to an agreement,

we go to work. Our head editor is able to truly paint our clients vision using only the

finest programs in the market. After the video has been complete with edits, visual

effects (if needed) and our clients are satisfied, we send the video to our head audio

producer, who begins writing the score and/or soundtrack. Upon completion, the final

product is sent back to our client for what we call the “First Cut”.
